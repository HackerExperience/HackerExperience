  Sets up instances for all types. If one is found to already exist in the target server, a conflict
  resolution logic takes place.

  Setup is triggered on:
  - Gateway: Server creation
  - Gateway: Sync request
  - Endpoint: Tunnel creation

  # Conflict resolution

  If a Gateway instance is found to already exist, nothing needs to be done. If an Endpoint instance
  is found to already exist, we make sure that the `tunnel_id` is updated -- by recreating it.

  # Companion tasks

  For each newly created Instance, a Task is also created. At first, this task has no target -- it
  will eventually be retargeted by the corresponding worker.
